# By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously?

Django signals are executed synchronously by default. When a signal is triggered, its connected receiver functions run immediately in the same thread, blocking any further execution until they complete. This behavior ensures that any dependent processes can be handled in a predictable manner. You can check this by observing the execution order in your application logs or console output.

When you send a signal, the connected receiver functions are invoked in the order they were connected. The main application thread waits for these functions to finish executing before continuing. This synchronous behavior ensures that any operations dependent on the signal's processing are completed before proceeding.

The provided code snippet demonstrates how to define a signal and its receiver in Django. When a specific action (like creating a user) triggers the signal, the receiver function is executed in the same thread, immediately performing any defined operations (e.g., logging or sending a notification).

You can verify the synchronous execution of signals by running tests where you check the order of execution to see that the receiver completes before any further processing occurs.

# Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller?
Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. This means that when a signal is emitted, the connected signal handlers are executed in the same thread that triggered the signal. When you emit a signal in Django, the signal handlers (the functions connected to the signal) are executed immediately in the same thread that initiated the signal. This behavior is essential for maintaining the state and context in which the signal was triggered.

For example, imagine you're in a web application and a user creates a new account. When you save that user instance, a signal like post_save is triggered. The signal handlers that you've set up to respond to this event will run in the same thread as the user request. This allows them to access any relevant data or variables from that request without issues.

Now, how can you check this for yourself? Here’s a quick process:

Set Up the Signal: First, create a signal handler function that prints out the current thread name. This function will be connected to a signal—like post_save for a user model.

Trigger the Signal: Next, perform an action that triggers the signal, such as creating a new user in your application.

Observe the Output: Run your code and check the console output. You should see the thread name printed by the signal handler.

Compare the Thread Names: Finally, check the thread name when you executed the action that triggered the signal. If the names match, it confirms that both the signal and its handlers are executed in the same thread.

In summary, this behavior is crucial because it allows your signal handlers to function correctly within the same execution context, making them more predictable and reliable.
